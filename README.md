# Limited Sniper
### Next update at 50 ‚≠ê
Limited Sniper let you add limited ids in config.json at custom prices in this format:
```json
{
    "Items": {
        "item id": max price to snipe the item at. eg: if you put 5 it will snipe the item if it becomes 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 robux,
        "15181542808": 1
    }
}
```
and will snipe any limited you added that reachs the max price you specified for that item.

*you can add multiple IDs at the same time by adding a comma at the end of each ID*

## IMPORTANT!

- If you don't want to use tor proxies and dont trust the tor-proxies.exe, delete the folder.
- **If main.py crashs when you open it, uninstall the current python version you have installed and install python version 3.11.x**
