# Limited Sniper
Limited Sniper let you add limited ids in config.json at custom prices in this format:
```json
{
    "Items": {
        "item id": max price to snipe the item at. eg: if you put 5 it will snipe the item if it becomes 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 robux,
        "15181542808": 1
    }
}
```
and will snipe any limited you added that reachs the max price you specified for that item.

*you can add multiple IDs at the same time by adding a comma at the end of each ID*
